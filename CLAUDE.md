# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a VSCode extension called "Claude Config Manager" that provides comprehensive management for Claude Code workflows. The extension offers two main features:

1. **CLAUDE.md Management**: Automatic PROJECT_PLAN rule injection and sync of CLAUDE.md configuration files directly to the workspace's existing Git repository
2. **Conversation History Browser**: Browse, view, and export Claude Code conversation history with a rich webview interface

The extension includes a custom activity bar icon with dual sidebar views for both configuration management and conversation browsing.

## Development Commands

### Build and Compilation
- `npm run compile` - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run watch` - Watch mode compilation for development

### Code Quality
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on TypeScript source files
- `npm run pretest` - Run compile and lint before testing

### Testing
- `npm run test` - Run extension tests (requires compilation first)

### Development Workflow
- Press `F5` in VSCode to launch Extension Development Host for debugging
- Package extension: `vsce package` (requires `npm install -g vsce`)

### Command Structure

Commands are modularized in `/src/commands/`:

**CLAUDE.md Commands:**

- `sync.ts` - Git sync operations (pull, add, commit, push)
- `edit.ts` - Open CLAUDE.md in editor
- Extension automatically adds PROJECT_PLAN integration rules to CLAUDE.md
- Manual command available: "Add PROJECT_PLAN Rule to CLAUDE.md"

**Conversation Commands:**

- `openConversations.ts` - Browse and manage conversation history
  - `openConversationsCommand` - Quick pick conversation selector
  - `viewConversationCommand` - Open conversation in webview
  - `exportConversationCommand` - Export conversations to files

**Usage Commands:**

- `usage.ts` - View usage statistics and token tracking information

### Key Dependencies

- `simple-git` - Git operations
- `fs-extra` - Enhanced file system operations
- `sharp` - SVG to PNG icon conversion (development only)
- VSCode API for extension functionality

### Asset Management

- **Icon**: Custom PNG icon (`assets/claude-icon.png`) converted from SVG using Sharp

## Configuration Settings

The extension uses VSCode configuration with prefix `claude-config`:

**CLAUDE.md Settings:**

- `autoSync` - Enable automatic sync on file changes (default: false)

**Conversation Settings:**

- `conversationDataPath` - Custom path to Claude conversation data directory (default: ~/.claude/projects)

**Usage Tracking Settings:**

- `tokenTrackingEnabled` - Enable/disable token usage tracking (default: true)
- `showUsageNotifications` - Show usage notifications after operations (default: false)
- `usageTracking.showPercentage` - Show usage percentage in status bar and tree views (default: true)
- `usageTracking.customLimits` - Custom usage limits override (e.g., {"daily": 2000000})
- `usageTracking.warningThresholds` - Usage percentage thresholds for warnings (warning: 80%, critical: 95%)
- **NEW v3.2.4**: `serviceTier` - Your Claude subscription tier (free, pro, max-100, max-200) for accurate usage calculations

## How It Works

### CLAUDE.md Management

The extension syncs CLAUDE.md files directly to the workspace's existing Git repository:

- Works with any Git repository (no additional setup required)
- Syncs `CLAUDE.md` in the workspace root
- Uses workspace's existing Git configuration and remote
- Commits directly to project's Git history with message "Update CLAUDE.md configuration"

### PROJECT_PLAN Integration

When CLAUDE.md is detected in the workspace:

- Extension automatically adds PROJECT_PLAN integration rules to CLAUDE.md
- Creates `.claude/.plans/PROJECT_PLAN.md` template when requested
- Instructions tell Claude Code to read and maintain the project plan
- Plan mode sessions use PROJECT_PLAN.md as the central repository
- Manual command available if automatic rule addition is needed

### Conversation History Browser

The extension provides comprehensive conversation history management:

**Data Source:**

- Reads JSONL files from Claude Code's local storage (default: `~/.claude/projects/`)
- Parses conversation metadata including timestamps, message counts, and project context
- Groups conversations by project for organized browsing

**Webview Interface:**

- Rich HTML conversation viewer with VSCode theme integration
- Real-time search functionality across conversation content
- Message-by-message display with proper formatting for user/assistant exchanges
- Tool usage display with syntax highlighting for tool calls and parameters

**Export Capabilities:**

- Export conversations to Markdown for documentation
- Export to JSON for programmatic processing
- Export to plain text for simple sharing
- Preserves conversation structure and metadata in all formats

**Security Features:**

- Path sanitization prevents directory traversal attacks
- Input validation on all user-provided paths and Git URLs
- Safe parsing of JSONL files with error handling
- Conversation files (`.claude/.chats/`) are excluded from Git tracking to prevent accidental secret exposure
- GitHub push protection integration to block commits containing sensitive data

### Usage Tracking & Statistics

The extension provides comprehensive token usage monitoring and cost estimation:

**Token Usage Tracking:**

- Monitors and tracks estimated token usage with cost estimation for each operation
- Tracks usage across different conversations and Claude Code interactions
- Provides real-time usage notifications after operations (configurable)

**UPDATED v3.2.4 - Claude Usage Tracking:**

- **Daily Usage Tracking**: Shows usage percentage based on daily estimates (aligned with Claude's session-based model)
- **Status Bar Integration**: Live updates with visual indicators: `üìä Claude: 15.2% (8h 30m)` showing current percentage and reset time
- **Manual Service Tier Configuration**: Set your actual Claude subscription tier for accurate percentage calculations
- **Session-Based Model**: Tracks usage aligned with Claude's 5-hour session windows and daily patterns
- **Visual Warnings**: Status icons change based on usage thresholds (üìä normal, ‚ö†Ô∏è warning at 80%, üö® critical at 95%)
- **Tree View Integration**: Percentage indicators displayed in both Claude Config and Usage Statistics sidebar views
- **Fixed False 100% Readings**: Resolved issues where usage showed 100% when Claude was still accessible

**Usage Statistics:**

- Comprehensive reporting with daily, weekly, and monthly breakdowns
- Cost estimation and usage analytics to help manage Claude usage
- Integration with conversation history for detailed usage insights

## PROJECT_PLAN Integration

### Added by Claude Config Manager Extension

When working on this project, always refer to and maintain the project plan located at `.claude/.plans/PROJECT_PLAN.md`.

**Instructions for Claude Code:**

1. **Read the project plan first** - Always check `.claude/.plans/PROJECT_PLAN.md` when starting work to understand the project context, architecture, and current priorities.
2. **Update the project plan regularly** - When making significant changes, discoveries, or completing major features, update the relevant sections in PROJECT_PLAN.md to keep it current.
3. **Use it for context** - Reference the project plan when making architectural decisions, understanding dependencies, or explaining code to ensure consistency with project goals.

**Plan Mode Integration:**

- **When entering plan mode**: Read the current PROJECT_PLAN.md to understand existing context and priorities
- **During plan mode**: Build upon and refine the existing project plan structure
- **When exiting plan mode**: ALWAYS update PROJECT_PLAN.md with your new plan details, replacing or enhancing the relevant sections (Architecture, TODO, Development Workflow, etc.)
- **Plan persistence**: The PROJECT_PLAN.md serves as the permanent repository for all planning work - plan mode should treat it as the single source of truth

This ensures better code quality and maintains project knowledge continuity across different Claude Code sessions and plan mode iterations.
