# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Claude Config Manager" extension will be documented in this file.

## [3.10.1] - 2025-10-05

### üßπ Simplification - Real Data Only

#### **Major Changes**
- **Removed all estimate-based features** (limits, burn rates, projections, percentages)
- **Simplified to show only actual ccusage data**:
  - Token usage (total tokens in window)
  - Cost (total cost in window)
  - Time window (start/end times)
  - Models used
  - API call count

#### **Why?**
ccusage v17.1.2 (and all versions) don't provide:
- `tokenLimitStatus` (always null)
- `burnRate` (always null)
- `projection` (always null)

These were aspirational features that never existed in ccusage CLI output.

#### **Technical Changes**
- Simplified `TokenWindowData` interface (6 fields vs 15+)
- Simplified `DisplayData` interface (6 fields vs 12+)
- Removed `parseSimpleData()`, `getSubscriptionInfo()`, `createProgressBar()`, `getStatusIcon()`
- Updated `UsageMonitorTreeProvider` to display real data only
- Cleaner, simpler codebase focused on what actually works

#### **User Benefits**
- ‚úÖ Shows accurate token usage from ccusage
- ‚úÖ No misleading percentages or projections
- ‚úÖ Clear, simple display of actual data
- ‚úÖ More reliable - no calculations that can go wrong

## [3.10.0] - 2025-10-05

### üîÑ Reverted to ccusage CLI Integration

#### **Why the Revert?**
The "native" JSONL parser (v3.8.0-3.9.1) was fundamentally flawed:
- ‚ùå Didn't understand 5-hour billing windows
- ‚ùå Couldn't track session vs weekly limits
- ‚ùå Miscalculated usage (showed 109.5M tokens vs actual ~75K)
- ‚ùå No subscription tier detection

#### **Back to ccusage v17.1.2**
- ‚úÖ **Accurate 5-hour window tracking** - Matches Claude's billing model
- ‚úÖ **Proper limit detection** - Session limits, weekly limits, tier-specific caps
- ‚úÖ **Correct usage calculation** - Matches `/usage` command output
- ‚úÖ **Subscription tier support** - Free, Pro, Max detection
- ‚úÖ **Proven reliability** - Battle-tested CLI tool

#### **Technical Changes**
- **Restored**: `CcusageService.ts` now uses ccusage CLI v17.1.2
- **Restored**: `TokenWindowMonitor.ts` uses ccusage blocks command
- **Kept**: `UsageCalculator.ts` available for future conversation analysis
- **Updated**: All methods use ccusage execution with smart package manager fallback

#### **User Benefits**
- Usage stats now match what you see in Claude CLI's `/usage` command
- Accurate percentage tracking (not inflated 54000%)
- Proper window reset times
- Real subscription limits

## [3.9.1] - 2025-10-05

### üêõ Bug Fix - Usage Calculation

#### **Fixed Token Counting**
- **Issue**: UsageCalculator was incorrectly adding cache tokens to totalTokens
  - Showed inflated numbers like 109.5M tokens when actual usage was much lower
  - Cache creation and cache read tokens were being added to the total
- **Fix**: Total tokens now only includes input + output tokens
  - Cache tokens are still tracked separately for cost calculation
  - Matches Claude API billing model
- **Files Changed**: `src/services/UsageCalculator.ts` (lines 341, 362)

### üìä Correct Display
- ‚úÖ Total tokens = input_tokens + output_tokens only
- ‚úÖ Cache tokens tracked separately for accurate cost calculation
- ‚úÖ Usage percentages now display correctly

## [3.9.0] - 2025-10-05

### üßπ Code Cleanup - Fork Manager Removal

#### **Removed Fork Manager Feature**
- **Reason**: Claude Code now has native fork management built-in
- **Removed Components**:
  - Removed `claude-fork-manager` tree view
  - Removed all fork-related commands (15+ commands)
  - Removed Fork Manager source files (`src/conversation/fork/`)
  - Removed context menu items for fork operations
  - Simplified extension.ts by removing fork initialization code

#### **Benefits**
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Complexity**: Removed duplicate functionality
- ‚úÖ **Smaller Package**: Eliminated unnecessary code
- ‚úÖ **Better UX**: Users can rely on Claude Code's native fork tools
- ‚úÖ **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to maintain and debug

#### **Updated Components**
- **package.json**: Removed fork manager view and commands
- **extension.ts**: Removed fork tree provider and related code
- **ConversationViewer.ts**: Removed fork analysis (now shows fork count as 0)
- **Usage Monitor**: Renamed from "CCUsage Monitor" to "Usage Monitor"

### üì¶ Package Updates
- Version: 3.8.0 ‚Üí 3.9.0
- Extension size: 1.24MB (200 files) - further optimization pending

## [3.8.0] - 2025-10-05

### üöÄ Major Performance Release - Native Usage Tracker

  - Calculates tokens by type (input, output, cache creation, cache read)
  - Accurate cost calculations based on model pricing
  - Time-range filtering and aggregation
  - Model breakdown and conversation tracking

- **Refactored**: `src/services/CcusageService.ts` - Migrated to native backend

  - Uses UsageCalculator internally for all operations
  - Maintains backward-compatible API (no breaking changes)
  - Converted legacy format handling for seamless migration

- **Updated**: `src/components/TokenWindowMonitor.ts` - Native 5-hour window tracking
